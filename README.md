I build bridges between words and data.  
Over the past decade at Yahoo, I shaped knowledge graphs, curated high-stakes editorial content, and designed annotation frameworks that kept content consistent and trustworthy at a global scale. At UC Berkeleyâ€™s MIDS program, Iâ€™ve deepened that foundation with machine learning, data pipelines, and visualization. Most recently, Iâ€™ve explored Generative AI through prompt engineering, RAG prototypes, and connecting retrieval systems with editorial standards.

What ties it all together is a focus on **clarity, consistency, and impact**â€”whether Iâ€™m labeling short-form copy, evaluating model outputs, or training an ensemble classifier.

## Content Editorial | Yahoo

**Knowledge Graph Curation & Annotation**

- Curated and annotated entities for Yahooâ€™s multilingual knowledge graph, ensuring accuracy and consistency across athlete, politician, and public figure data quality.
- Followed editorial rules for terminology, formatting, and disambiguation (e.g., name variants, titles).
- Partnered with engineers to feed these annotations into data pipeline ingestion systems, improving relevance ranking and user experience.

**Tentpole Events (Olympics, Elections, World Cup)**

- Created and maintained structured bios and content metadata for high-visibility global events.
- Applied editorial standards at scale, balancing speed with precision under breaking news conditions.
- Collaborated cross-functionally to ensure consistency across teams and languages.

**Annotation & QA**

- Labeled and audited large datasets for ad and search quality, training contributors worldwide.
- Designed editorial guidelines and taxonomies that directly supported ML model evaluation and refinement.
- Conducted QA on annotations to ensure style, accuracy, and consistency with established standards.

## Analytics & Insights | Yahoo

**Contributor Query Analysis (Yahoo)**

- Analyzed millions of queries to surface seasonal trends and improve ad relevance models.
- Built dashboards in Google Sheets to communicate KPIs to product teams.
- Due to confidentiality, details are limited; this work involved **model A/B testing** for improving ad relevance.

## Machine Learning | UC Berkeley MIDS

**Repeat Customer Prediction Pipeline**

- Built end-to-end ML pipeline: data cleaning, feature engineering, model training, ensemble methods.
- Tools: Python, scikit-learn, Keras, Matplotlib.
- Results: Improved baseline DummyClassifier (~50%) to stacked ensemble (~75% validation accuracy).
- **Code:** [GitHub](https://github.com/mikelcal/w207-ml-project)

## Data Visualization | UC Berkeley MIDS

**CO Pollution Dashboard**

- Flask + D3.js dashboard with interactive choropleth maps and wind vector animations.
- Custom API endpoints for state averages and correlation analysis.
- Deployed on DigitalOcean for live access.
- **Live Demo:** https://co-dashboard.mikelcal.co/ â€¢ **Code:** [Github](https://github.com/mikelcal/co_dashboard)

**Tableau Public Scatter Plot**

- Visualizing international soccer athlete data, segmented by player height and nationality
- **Tableau Public:** [Player Data](https://public.tableau.com/views/Unit2-MikelCalderon/Sheet2?:language=en-US&:sid=&:redirect=auth&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link)

**Model Performance Comparison**

## Generative AI | Workshops & Prototypes

**RAG with Redis (2025 Workshop)**

- Built a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline using Redis as a vector database.
- Indexed local documents, embedded text, and generated context-aware responses with citations.
- Experience covered ingestion, embedding, retrieval, and evaluation of outputs.
- Reinforces ability to connect editorial standards to GenAI outputs through retrieval pipelines.
